# Machine-Learning-Model-for-Text-Augmentation
This program will utilize a machine learning model to take user input and
produce output from text dataset augmentation. Specifically, the model will take a
user input of a text, find the top synonym of the text, the top antonym of the text,
the next top synonym of the antonym of the text, the next top antonym of the synonym
of the text, and output the four texts.
